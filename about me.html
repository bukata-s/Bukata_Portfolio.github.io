  <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm a fifteen-year-old girl and the first of four (4) children. Ndola, Zambia, was my first home, where I lived with my parents and my three younger siblings for ten (10) years before we re-located to where we currently reside, Lusaka, Zambia. I have been my school's website developer and administrator for almost four years (4 years).</p>

    <h2>My Academic Background</h2>
    <p>My education background is, some would say, quite profound, having attended three (3) schools in my home town of Ndola and furthering my education at two (2) other schools here in Lusaka, where I currently reside. The first school I was ever enrolled in was a minute kindergarten school, Hug a Bug, which I was a scholar at from the ages of two (2) to four (4). From there, I went on to primary school and was enrolled in Ndola Trust School, which I attended from reception to grade five (5). Thereafter, I re-located to Lusaka, where I transferred schools and attended school at Lubu Road School for grades six (6) and seven (7). I then graduated from primary school and went on to secondary school, which I'm currently attending at Saint Mary's Girls Secondary School.</p>

    <h2>My Interests and Hobbies</h2>
    <p>Growing up, I was a girl with many interests, never really limiting myself but rather allowing many things to peak my interest. As I grew up, my broad interest in the many things of this world wasn't at all what set me back, but the lack of opportunities to pursue those interests. I didn't, however, let those setbacks hinder me from pursuing the interests I could pursue. Hence, it allowed me to have multiple hobbies throughout my childhood. I ventured into hobbies like baking, swimming, tennis, ballet, and music. More recently, I have grown to love reading—fictional books, to be specific; it has become all I do whenever I have time to spare. It is not only from reading books that I feel ultimate joy, but also from the art of collecting the books.</p>
